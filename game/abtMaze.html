  <h2></a>How we Built the maze</h2>
  <p>
    The user navigates through the maze where each room is a separate HTML
    page generated and loaded by JavaScript. The game listens for entering
    an area defined as an ‘exit,’ upon entering this area, a button will
    appear that can take them to a new room. Therein lies the maze. The goal
    is to find 5 objective items to unlock the exit and escape. Along the
    way, the player will encounter deadly enemies that can only be escaped
    from, not killed. The user uses the arrow keys or WASD to move the
    character through the maze. The maze is room-by-room with anywhere from
    1 to 4 entry points and entry points being able to load the player
    character into another room.

  <h3>errors we encountered:</h3>


  <h2>How we built the sprites</h2>

  <h2>Errors encounters and how we fixed them</h2>

  <p>
    In earlier versions of the game, rooms were drawn with lines. A
    missing "ctx.beginPath()" call resulted in the lines being drawn
    increasing exponentially, dragging down frame rates and resulting in
    old rooms being drawn on top of new rooms.
  </p>
  <p>
    After collision was implemented, the player could clip through the
    bottom or top walls if there was a hallway by aligning themselves
    exactly with the edge of the wall. This was fixed by switching the
    inequalities from "&gt;" and "&lt;" to "&gt;=" and "&lt;=".
  </p>
  <p>
    The level manager did not properly check if the player was attempting to
    move outside of the maze. This resulted in the player walking off screen
    and the level manager saving the now-invalid permission, then
    immediately crashing and permanently softlocking the game.

<h2>How we could expand it</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We thought of having a key system where 5 keys spread out across the maze must be collected before the escape opens.</li>
        <li>A monster that randomly spawns upon entering a new room. It will shamble towards the player and if it gets too close, the game ends. It can follow the player through a few hallways.</li>
        <li>A level editor to make your own maze.</li>
        <li>A difficulty button to change the size of maze you are put in.</li>
    </ul>
