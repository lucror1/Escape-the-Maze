<h2></a>How We Built The Maze</h2>
<p>The user navigates through the maze where each room is a separate HTML page generated and loaded by JavaScript.
  The game listens for entering an area defined as an ‘exit,’ upon entering this area, a button will appear that can take them to a new room. 
  Therein lies the maze. The goal is to find 5 objective items to unlock the exit and escape. 
  Along the way, the player will encounter deadly enemies that can only be escaped from, not killed. The user uses the arrow keys or WASD to move the character through the maze. 
  The maze is room-by-room with anywhere from 1 to 4 entry points and entry points being able to load the player character into another room.</p>

<h3>Errors We Encountered:</h3>
    <p></p>

<h2>How we built the sprites</h2>
    <p>Hudson did it. He tried to embody the average NCSSM student in a stickman's face.</p>

<h2>How we could expand it</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We thought of having a key system where 5 keys spread out across the maze must be collected before the escape opens.</li>
        <li>A monster that randomly spawns upon entering a new room. It will shamble towards the player and if it gets too close, the game ends. It can follow the player through a few hallways.</li>
        <li>A level editor to make your own maze.</li>
        <li>A difficulty button to change the size of maze you are put in.</li>
    </ul>
