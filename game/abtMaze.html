<p>The user navigates through the maze where each room is a separate HTML page generated and loaded by JavaScript.
  The game listens for entering an area defined as an ‘exit,’ upon entering this area, a button will appear that can take them to a new room. 
  Therein lies the maze. The goal is to find 5 objective items to unlock the exit and escape. 
  Along the way, the player will encounter deadly enemies that can only be escaped from, not killed. The user uses the arrow keys or WASD to move the character through the maze. 
  The maze is room-by-room with anywhere from 1 to 4 entry points and entry points being able to load the player character into another room.</p>
